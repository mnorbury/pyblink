Jenkins
=======

Jenkins is a Java-based Continuous Integration (CI) system. At LCO, Jenkins is used to build, test and deploy both
Java and Python software. Each software project can be in one of three build states: successful, unstable or failed.
In addition, a project can also be in a state of building.

Jenkins & Blink(1)
------------------

The various build states are mapped to the `blink(1) <http://thingm.com/products/blink-1.html>`_ as follows:-

If a project is currently building the `blink(1) <http://thingm.com/products/blink-1.html>`_ will pulse. Since Jenkins can build multiple software projects at
the same time, the frequency of the pulse can be used to indicate this. The frequency of the pulse (Hz) represents
the number of projects currently building. In the case of multiple projects, the color represents and aggregated build
state according to the following diagram:-

In addition to the color and the pulse, the brightness of the `blink(1) <http://thingm.com/products/blink-1.html>`_ represents the age of the state change e.g.
recent state changes are bright and old are dim.
