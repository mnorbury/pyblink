The Challenge
-------------

The `blink(1) <http://thingm.com/products/blink-1.html>`_ is an open source
programmable USB LED. It can change colours and brightness. You can also
control the fade rate and make it pulse.

The challenge is to code something awesome using the
`blink(1) <http://thingm.com/products/blink-1.html>`_. We will judge the
results, based on creativity, coolness, and usefulness. There will be a
lunchtime science fair-style demo to show off for anyone else at `LCOGT <http://lcogt.net/>`_ who's
interested. And last but not least, there will be a not insubstantial prize
for the best project!

Here are the challenge parameters.

* You have until the end of the UTC day on Monday 11th August. So just over
  3 weeks.

* You can use any programming language.

* You can implement several different things if you like.

* If you make something that is useful for LCOGT, that is a bonus, but it is
  not a requirement.

* You'll probably take a pure software approach. But you are free to hack the hardware or install it in something else if you like.

* You must make your code available to me by submission time. Feel free to
  open source it if you like.

* You have the equivalent of one afternoon a week, for three weeks, during normal
  working hours where you are free to work on this. I recommend Friday, but it's
  up to you. You can of course do as much as you like on your own time...
