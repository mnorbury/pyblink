The `blink(1) <http://thingm.com/products/blink-1.html>`_ is a tri-color USB LED visual aid, which has multi-language
software support. It can produce any *RGB* color, which can then be enhanced in many different ways including
variable pulse frequencies, different brightness levels and arbitrary patterns.

The challenge is to code something awesome using the
`blink(1) <http://thingm.com/products/blink-1.html>`_, based on creativity, coolness, and usefulness.

This project utilizes the `blink(1) <http://thingm.com/products/blink-1.html>`_ to represent visually the current build state of the LCO software system.
