Introduction
============

- The blink

The blink(1) is a tri-color USB LED visual aid, which has multi-language software support.

-- Dimensions of the blink e.g. color, pulse frequency, brightness

The blink(1) can produce any *RGB* color, which can then be enhanced in many different ways including
variable pulse frequencies, different brightness levels and arbitrary patterns.

- The problem

The challenge is to code something awesome using the
`blink(1) <http://thingm.com/products/blink-1.html>`_, based on creativity, coolness, and usefulness.


This project utilizes the blink(1) to represent visually the current build state of the LCO software system.


Jenkins
=======

Jenkins is a Java-based Continuous Integration (CI) system. At LCO, Jenkins is used to build, test and deploy both
Java and Python software. Each software project can be in one of three build states: successful, unstable or failed.
In addition, a project can also be in a state of building.

Jenkins & Blink(1)
==================

-- How they map to dimensions

The various build states are mapped to the blink(1) as follows:-

successful -> blue
unstable -> yellow
failed -> red

If a project is currently building the blink(1) will pulse. Since Jenkins can build multiple software projects at
the same time, the frequency of the pulse can be used to indicate this. The frequency of the pulse (Hz) represents
the number of projects currently building. In the case of multiple projects, the color represents and aggregated build
state according to the following diagram:-

**Diagram**

In addition to the color and the pulse, the brightness of the blink(1) represents the age of the state change e.g.
recent state changes are bright and old are dim.


- Additional goals for this project:-

-- Using Python 3.x
-- Using generators
-- Unit testing (including mocking)
-- Using github pages
-- Using Sphinx documentation
-- Using Travis CI
-- Using Coveralls code coverage

Design
